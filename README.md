# Out of this World: Planetary Pursuits!
> Done as part of the Fall 2021 CPPGDC Game Pitches

### Summary
> As an intern for the international space authority, your supervisors have decided to put you on a specific, high-profile job. And that is... to "woo" the planets. Yes, you heard that right. As it turns out, the Planets are celestial beings who are interested in hosting humans in their world as well. Will you be able to show them what life as a human is like, or will something, or someone, get in your way?

### About Us
> "Out of this World: Planetary Pursuits!" is a 2D visual novel/dating simulator made as part of the Fall 2021 Cal Poly Pomona Game Development Club game pitches. Every semester, the club holds projects based off of video game pitches presented by members of the club. Then, people team up to create each game with the hopes of developing a minimum viable product by the end of the school semester.
